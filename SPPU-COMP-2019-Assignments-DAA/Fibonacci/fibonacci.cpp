/**
 * Time Complexity: O(2^n)
 * For each call fibonacci(n), it recursively calls fibonacci(n-1) and fibonacci(n-2). 
 * This creates a tree of recursive calls where each node represents a function call.
 * The size of this recursive call tree is exponential, and the time complexity is O(2^n) 
 * because for each n, you essentially have two branches (n-1 and n-2).

 * Space Complexity: O(n)
 * The recursion depth is proportional to n because it will reach the base case after n 
 * recursive calls. Since there is no extra memory allocated except for the recursive call 
 * stack, the space complexity is linear.
